Hi, I’m @Boinga15. I'm a random guy trying to program stuff. Don't question it.

I’m interested in programming games, since I don't actually know much programming, so programming games is quite easy.

I’m currently learning C++ and Python since they are my favourite languages. I hope to improve in the near future.
